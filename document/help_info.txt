How does the AI assistant work?
The AI uses advanced speech recognition and natural language technologies to understand your speech and generate natural responses based on the conversation context.

Which languages are supported?
English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and other popular languages are supported. The complete list is available in the app settings.

What's the difference between modes?
Real-time mode is a live dialogue like a phone call. Voice messages allow you to think through your response and speak at your own pace.

Can I cancel my subscription?
Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time in your account settings. Access to features is maintained until the end of the paid period.

Are my conversations saved?
Conversations are saved for progress analysis, but you can delete them at any time. We do not share data with third parties.

Do I need special equipment?
Any device with a microphone and internet connection is sufficient. For better quality, we recommend headphones or a headset.

Voice assistant settings?
You can choose one of the available languages, assistant response length, and select a topic for conversation. All these settings are available only after authorization.
